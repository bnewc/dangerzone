  - vulnerability: CVE-2024-5535
  # CVE-2024-5171
  # =============
  #
  # NVD Entry: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5171
  # Verdict: Dangerzone is not affected. The rationale is the following:
  #
  # The affected library, `libaom.so`, is linked by GStreamer's `libgstaom.so`
  # library. The vulnerable `aom_img_alloc` function is only used when
  # **encoding** a video to AV1. LibreOffce uses the **decode** path instead,
  # when generating thumbnails.

  # CVE-2024-45491, CVE-2024-45492

  # * https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45491
  # * https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45492
  #
  # Verdict: Dangerzone is not affected. The rationale is the following:
  #
  # The vulnerabilities that have been assigned to these CVEs affect only 32-bit
  # architectures. Dangerzone ships only 64-bit images to users.

  # CVE-2024-45490
  # ==============
  #
  # NVD Entry: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45490
  # Verdict: Dangerzone is not affected. The rationale is the following:
  #
  # In order to exploit this bug, the caller must pass a negative length to the
  # `XML_ParseBuffer` function. This function is not directly used by
  # LibreOffice, which instead uses a higher-level wrapper. Therefore, our
  # understanding is that this path cannot be exploited by attackers.
